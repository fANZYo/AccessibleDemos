# Accessible Modal Dialogs

A modal dialog is an overlay window component that appears above the rest of the page. Content under the dialog becomes inert and an action is required from the user.

Modal Dialogs have become somewhat of a controversial component. On one hand UXers don't like them due to their intrusiveness, on the other hand businesses and managers seem to like them due to their forcing nature.

## The Risks

Failing to make your dialog accessible can be a very serious barrier to users with disabilities who require keyboard navigation.

Focus management is key, if it is not handled correctly users might be lost in the page unable to interact with the modal, and if that modal is the only way to check-out on an e-commerce website, certain these same users may never be able to buy anything from that e-commerce website.
